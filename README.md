Usage:

1 - Access /admin/config/user-interface/extlink <br>
2 - Select 'Warn using a modal dialog (colorbox)' in the field 'When external links are clicked' <br>
3 - Select 'Yes' in the field 'Activate custom messages for external links.' <br>
4 - Open the fieldset 'Add new warning texts' <br>
5 - Fill in the first field with the selector you want <br>
6 - Fill in the textarea with the message you want for that selector. <br>
