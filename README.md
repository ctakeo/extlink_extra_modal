This is a modified version of the External Links Extra and External Links. Custom messages for custom selectors have been implemented.

// COLORBOX MODULE IS NEEDED!!!!!! //

Usage:

1 - Access /admin/config/user-interface/extlink 
2 - Select 'Warn using a modal dialog (colorbox)' in the field 'When external links are clicked' 
3 - Select 'Yes' in the field 'Activate custom messages for external links.' 
4 - Open the fieldset 'Add new warning texts' 
5 - Fill in the first field with the selector you want 
6 - Fill in the textarea with the message you want for that selector. 


Note: The parts modified by me have been wrapped with /Coded by Shigaki/
Note2: Known bugs list have been added to the top of the extlink_extra.module file.
